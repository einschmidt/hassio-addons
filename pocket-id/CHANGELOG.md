## 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fix encryption path error @einschmidt (#85)

> ⚠️ **Important notice:** This fix changes the location of the encryption key to a persistent data path.  
> Unfortunately, this change **breaks existing installations**. To apply the fix, the add-on must be **uninstalled and installed fresh**, which will result in **data loss**.  
> Users will need to re-apply their configurations manually.  
> If possible, I recommend **restoring from a backup** created prior to version 1.2.0 to recover any important data before upgrading to v1.3.0

I am very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.
